        <p>In 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu, under which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding some border land to British India. Under British influence, a monarchy was set up in 1907; three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs, and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. This role was assumed by independent India after 1947. Two years later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned to Bhutan the areas annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense and foreign relations.

        <p>In March 2005, King Jigme Singye WANGCHUCK unveiled the government's draft constitution - which introduced major democratic reforms - and pledged to hold a national referendum for its approval. In December 2006, the King abdicated the throne in favor of his son, Jigme Khesar Namgyel WANGCHUCK. In early 2007, India and Bhutan renegotiated their treaty, eliminating the clause that stated that Bhutan would be "guided by" India in conducting its foreign policy, although Thimphu continues to coordinate closely with New Delhi. Elections for seating the country's first parliament were completed in March 2008; the king ratified the country's first constitution in July 2008. Bhutan experienced a peaceful turnover of power following parliamentary elections in 2013, which routed the incumbent party. The disposition of some 23,000 Nepali Bhutanese refugees who fled or were forced out of Bhutan in the 1990s - housed in two UN refugee camps in Nepal - remains unresolved.</p>

        <p>Like many other colonies, Burma achieved its independence in 1948, and was, for a brief period, a democratic state.  Though independent, Burma never achieved overall peace, and near constant civil war has plagued Burma since independence.  Broken British promises and World War 2 alliances created the tension that devolved into minority ethnic unrest and dreams of independent states.  These freedom and independence movements, both violent and non-violent, were unanimously met with violent and brutal suppression.  
        </p>
        <p>Democratic rule of Burma ended in 1962 when General Ne Win gained control through a military coup d’état.  The country has been under military rule more or less since then.  Throughout the 70’s Burma experimented with its own form of socialism mixed with superstition.  These failed policies led to a crippled economy and Burma was transformed from the largest rice exporter in Asia to a rice importer.  Prior to this period, Burma had high levels of education and literacy and was home to some of the best universities in Southeast Asia.  The educational institutions were dismantled during this period and the general population suffered intellectually.
        </p>
        <p>General Ne Win’s rule and the reduction in Burmese living standards incited opposition and his time in power was marked by near constant revolts and protests.  The biggest protests came in 1988, called the “8888 Uprising,” and were led mainly by students.  These protests, like others before, were met with violence and massive loss of civilian life.  During this period, a common enemy led to unlikely bonds and pairing between urban Burman students and the already organized minority resistance groups.  
        </p>
        <p>The military authorities never ceded power but made illusions of concessions over the next few decades.  In 1990, Burma held its first free elections since Ne Win had gained power and Aung San Suu Kyi’s political party, the NDL, won over 80% of the seats of government.  However, these results were never acknowledged or implemented and many members of the opposition were jailed or disappeared.  Over this time period the ruling authorities made many symbolic changes to shed the yoke of British imperialism, such as changing the name of the country from Burma to Myanmar and the spelling of many cities’ names.  The capital was also relocated from Rangoon to the newly created city of Nay Pyi Taw.</p>
        <p>Despite these changes, and a slight easing of suppression, the resistance never ceased.  In 2007, another large revolt broke out, this time led by the saffron-robed Buddhist monks and aptly titled the “Saffron Revolution.”  Again, this movement was met with an iron fist and a massive loss of civilian life.  These actions led to some of the strongest international sanctions to date.</p>
        <p>In 2008 nature itself turned on Myanmar, when Cyclone Nargis claimed the lives of over 100,000 people and did massive damage to the country’s already underdeveloped infrastructure.  The military government was impotent in providing assistance for those affected and stalled international aid out of fear of espionage.</p>
        <p>Over the last five years the government has taken some steps to move toward a civilian government and democratic constitution.  Exactly how far these steps will go and how real they are is debatable.  Some positive signs have been the release from house arrest of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her subsequent election to parliament, as well as the release of some of the political prisoners.  The remainders of the political prisoners have been promised to be released entirely by the end of 2013.</p>

        <p>The 1972 Burundians are a group of refugees, primarily of Hutu ethnicity, who fled their homeland in mid-1972 following a campaign of violence by the Tutsi-dominated government against the Hutu population. Burundi is a small, densely populated country, bordered by the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and Tanzania, that has been plagued by civil strife since it gained independence from Belgium in 1962.</p>
        <p>Often called the first genocide in the Great Lakes region, the events of 1972 killed some 200,000 Burundians and triggered the flight of approximately 150,000 refugees to Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), with most fleeing to Tanzania. In the after-math of the genocide, Hutu citizens in Burundi were systematically repressed and purged from the army, civil service, and university system.</p>
        <p>In October 1993, 20 years after the 1972 flight, the assassination of Burundi’s first Hutu president triggered widespread ethnic fighting and the exodus of another 500,000 refugees. A year later, the Rwandan genocide—in which Hutu extremists murdered nearly 1 million Tutsi—took place. Over the following weeks, the number of refugees fleeing into Tanzania swelled to 470,000. These refugees, some of whom were members of the militias and Rwandan army responsible for the genocide, posed a security risk in the region and stretched to near breaking point the resources of the Tanzanian government and the relief agencies.</p>

        <p>The ongoing Congolese refugee crisis is the product of nearly 16 years of armed conflict and unrest in the DRC, with the eastern provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu bearing the brunt of the violence. By the end of 2012, more than 2.4 million Congolese were internally displaced and more than 460,000 had sought asylum in neighboring countries. The highly complex conflict, which at times has involved the armies of nine countries and dozens of other armed groups, was touched off in 1996 when Rwanda invaded the DRC in pursuit of the génocidaires, the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide who had taken refuge in eastern DRC and were regrouping in order to retake political leadership in Rwanda. Years of conflict followed, including the first and second Congo wars, in 1996 and 1998. The 1998 war is sometimes called “Africa’s World War” because of the number of countries involved in the conflict.</p>
        <p>Although a peace accord was signed in 2003, unrest still plagues eastern DRC, including the provinces of North and South Kivu, Orientale, and Katanga, as armed groups fight among themselves and with the central government for control of the region and its rich resources. According to a 2012 U.S. Department of State fact sheet on the Congo, armed groups have committed “numerous, serious abuses with impunity—some of which may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity—including unlawful killings, disappearances, mass rape, and torture.” Sexual violence, used as a weapon of war, is so common in eastern DRC that human rights groups have called the area “the most dangerous place in the world to be a woman.”</p>

        <p>For most of the 20th century, British colonial rulers viewed the north and south of Sudan as separate entities. The first Sudanese civil war (1955–1972) erupted just before independence, prompted by angry southerners who had been promised and then denied regional autonomy. The fighting resulted in the death of half a million people, mostly civilians, and forced hundreds of thousands to flee from their homes. In 1972, the Addis Ababa Agreement negotiated peace between the southern rebels, known as the Anyanya, and Khartoum. The peace deal included power-sharing agreements, security guarantees, and political and economic autonomy for the south.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to quiet critics in the north and consolidate his power, then-Sudanese President Jaafar al-Nimieri introduced legal measures in 1983 that abolished southern governing autonomy. Nimieri returned power to Khartoum, declared Arabic the official language, and imposed Sharia’a law over the entire country. In response, southerners mobilized around the southern rebel army, the Sudanese People’s Liberation Army (SPLA), led by Dr. John Garang. Rather than fight for southern independence, the SPLA posited that Sudan could be transformed into a multiracial, multilingual, multireligious, and multiethnic state.</p>
        <p>In the north, Islamists gained political strength and on June 30, 1989, Brigadier-General Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir led a military coup, bringing to power the National Islamist Front (NIF) government. The NIF intensified the war with the south, conducting the fighting with systematic and widespread assaults against civilians. The war continued until 2005, when a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was signed in Abuja, Nigeria, between Garang and Bashir. As part of that peace agreement, citizens of the south were given the opportunity for a future vote as to whether to remain part of Sudan or to break off and become an independent country.Amid much optimism, and with support from the United States and the international community, the referendum was held in January 2011, and the citizens of South Sudan voted overwhelmingly for independence. On July 9, 2011, the Republic of South Sudan was born.</p>
        <p>There are unresolved issues that make for an uncertain future for the world’s newest country. Sudan and South Sudan share not only a history, but also significant cross-border interests, including trade, migration, and resource development, especially with regard to the oil rich border areas. Because of the long history of violence and fears of ongoing interference, southerners greatly distrust their northern neighbors, and the two countries have yet to find a way to respect each other’s sovereignty and peacefully negotiate their relations.</p>
        <p>There are tensions over the disputed region of Abyei, which has large oil reserves, and these tensions threaten the economic well-being and security of both countries. In the border areas of the Nuba Mountains of South Kordofan, a humanitarian crisis, in the context of a civil war between the government of Sudan and rebels from the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement—north, has impacted large swaths of the population. By mid-2013, hundreds of thousands of civilians had fled the fighting as the Sudanese air force indiscriminately bombed civilian targets, and humanitarian groups reported on the dangers of widespread famine because the government of Sudan had blocked aid to peoples in the mountains.</p>
        <p>Within South Sudan itself, intercommunal violence continues to be widespread, due to a range of issues—the availability of weapons, ethnic tensions among armed groups, corruption, and limited economic opportunities. The country faces an ongoing challenge of creating a democratic system of governance in a region with little history and few models for such practices. A political crisis that began in December 2013 has erupted into a large-scale civil conflict that has taken on an ethnic cast, as Dinka militias and supporters of the president, Salva Kiir, battle Nuer forces loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar for control of key cities and towns. Citizens are being targeted on the basis of their ethnic identity, and some one million civilians have been displaced as of May 2014.</p>
